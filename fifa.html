      FIFA (/ˈfiːfə/; stands for Fédération Internationale de Football Association (French), meaning International
      Association Football Federation[3]) is the international governing body of association football, beach football
      and futsal. It was founded in 1904[4] to oversee international competition among the national associations of
      Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Headquartered in Zürich,
      Switzerland, its membership now comprises 211 national associations. These national associations must each also be
      members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: CAF (Africa), AFC (Asia and
      Australia), UEFA (Europe), CONCACAF (North & Central America and the Caribbean), OFC (Oceania) and CONMEBOL (South
      America).

      FIFA outlines a number of objectives in the organizational Statutes, including growing association football
      internationally, providing efforts to ensure it is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair
      play.[5] It is responsible for the organization and promotion of association football's major international
      tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991.
      Although FIFA does not solely set the laws of the game, that being the responsibility of the International
      Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies and enforces the rules across all FIFA
      competitions.[6] All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from sponsorship; in 2018, FIFA had revenues of over US
      $4.6 billion, ending the 2015–2018 cycle with a net positive of US$1.2 billion, and had cash reserves of over
      US$2.7 billion.[7]
