      PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a battle royale game developed and
      published by PUBG Studios, a subsidiary of Krafton. The game, which was inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle
      Royale, is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and expanded into a
      standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island
      where they scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The
      available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever
      tightening space to force encounters. The last surviving player (or team) wins the round. It is the first game in
      the PUBG Universe series.
