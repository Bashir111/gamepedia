            Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game franchise published by Activision. Starting out in 2003,
            it
            first focused on games set in World War II. Over time, the series has seen games set in the midst of the
            Cold
            War, futuristic worlds, and the modern day. The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then also by
            Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld games were made by other developers. The most
            recent title, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, was released on October 28, 2022.

            The series originally focused on the World War II setting, with Infinity Ward developing the first (2003)
            and
            second (2005) titles in the series and Treyarch developing the third (2006). Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
            (2007) introduced a new, modern setting, and proved to be the breakthrough title for the series, creating
            the
            Modern Warfare sub-series. The game's legacy also influenced the creation of a remastered version, released
            in
            2016. Two other entries, Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and Modern Warfare 3 (2011), were made. The sub-series
            received
            a reboot with Modern Warfare in 2019, with a sequel released in 2022. Infinity Ward have also developed two
            games outside of the Modern Warfare sub-series, Ghosts (2013) and Infinite Warfare (2016). Treyarch made one
            last World War II-based game, World at War (2008), before releasing Black Ops (2010) and subsequently
            creating
            the Black Ops sub-series. Four other entries, Black Ops II (2012), III (2015), 4 (2018), and Cold War (2020)
            were made, the latter in conjunction with Raven Software. Sledgehammer Games, who were co-developers for
            Modern
            Warfare 3, have also developed three titles, Advanced Warfare (2014), WWII (2017), and Vanguard (2021).
